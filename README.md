Authors: Eric Fan, Christofer Forbes, Emma Xia, Brian Ho

## Project Description
The dataset will be working with is on **Trending YouTube Video Statistics**. We found this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/data) and according to that website, the top three contributors go by the names _Donyoe_, _Quan Nguyen_, and _Peter_. The data is based on the views, ratings, comments, and the categories of Trending YouTube Videos. Many people would potentially be interseted in this kind of data, such as **YouTubers**, **YouTube watchers** that range from kids to adults, and the **advertisers** that place ads on popular YouTube channels. However, will be focusing on **YouTubers in the USA** as our main audience, as the statistics will benefit them. From these statistics, they will be _able to understand the types of videos and categories that are trendy and stay trendy_ on the platform. This will enable success to continue in their own channels. YouTubers will also be able to see the _relevancy of ratings (likes to dislike ratio) and its benefit to their videos_ on the website.

## Technical Description
